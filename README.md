# Jason Carter – README

I'm Jason (jcar). This README is an attempt to give you a look under the hood—how I think, what I value, how I lead, and how I show up for you and the team. It's a living doc. Just like me, it’s always in motion.

---

## My Role

I lead technical talent and build engineering capability at **Valent Partners**, a consulting firm solving complex problems for enterprise clients. My role exists at the intersection of strategy, delivery, engineering, and people development.

### My Mission:
- Cultivate **technical depth** across the firm
- Bring **clarity and traction** to ambiguous challenges
- Build **systems that scale**—both human and technical
- Elevate our **thinking, quality, and outcomes**
- Protect space for people to do **great work**

---

## What I Value

- **Autonomy + Ownership**  
  I don’t micromanage. I trust high-agency people who take initiative, think critically, and finish what they start.

- **Clarity Wins**  
  Whether it’s an architecture diagram, a meeting, or a strategy—clarity cuts through noise. I crave and create it.

- **Depth Over Noise**  
  I admire those who go deep in their craft, can defend their reasoning, and know when to challenge assumptions.

- **Decisiveness with Empathy**  
  I move fast. I value action. But I also respect how decisions land on real people. The human cost matters.

- **Truthful Feedback**  
  I give it. I want it. I’m direct, but not unkind. I believe frictionless truth-telling builds trust and performance.

- **Big-Picture Systems Thinking**  
  I instinctively zoom out. I see patterns across teams, tech, and time. I bring that view to help connect your work to the broader mission.

## What You Can Expect From Me

- **Candor & Conviction**  
  I don’t sugarcoat, but I’m never careless with my words. I’ll speak plainly, with your growth in mind.

- **Big-Picture Thinking**  
  I’ll push us to see patterns, systems, and second-order effects. Especially when we’re in the weeds.

- **Reliable Backup in Tough Situations**  
  When pressure hits, I’m there. I’ll run interference, escalate when needed, or help shoulder the load.

- **Coaching That Matches Your Ambition**  
  I’ll help you stretch into hard problems. If you want growth, I’ll go all in on your development.

- **Respect for Your Time and Space**  
  I don’t expect constant availability. I work hard and then unplug. I want the same for you.

---

## What I Expect From You

- **Own Your Craft**  
  Be curious, be intentional, and invest in your skill set. Whether code, client service, or leadership—mastery matters.

- **Act With Integrity**  
  Say what you mean. Follow through. Protect trust—internally and externally.

- **Push the Edges**  
  Bring better ideas. Challenge the status quo. Offer critique, not just compliance.

- **Work the Problem**  
  When faced with ambiguity, don’t freeze. Start somewhere. Iterate. Learn forward.

- **Give and Receive Feedback Well**  
  Feedback is a gift. The uncomfortable ones are often the most useful. Let's sharpen each other.

- **Model Calm Under Fire**  
  I notice who remains composed when stakes are high. That presence earns trust.

## My Quirks (And How to Work With Me)

- I default to **thinking mode**, not feeling mode. I try to check for impact, but feel free to bring it to my attention if I miss something.
- I’m intensely **protective of my calendar**—it’s how I create space to think and lead.
- I value **concise, direct communication**. If it can be a bulleted Slack message, it should be.
- I don’t need pleasantries or preamble. Say the thing.
- I’ll push for **“better” even when “good enough” is acceptable**—this isn’t always necessary, so feel free to say, “We’re past the ROI line.”

---

## How I Work

- **Core Hours**: ~8:00am–5:00pm CST. I’m occasionally asynchronous, but I try to protect team time.
- **Communication Preference**: Slack or text. Call if it’s urgent.
- **Meetings**: Come with purpose, leave with action. Otherwise, cancel it.
- **Availability**: I’m here for you. If you need me, say so—don’t wait for a slot to open up.

## What Drives Me

I’m fueled by hard challenges, elegant systems, and helping others grow into their edge. I don’t seek comfort. I seek excellence. I find deep satisfaction in watching people unlock a new level—technically, professionally, personally.

I think a lot. I write to understand. I fish to quiet the mind. I hike to recalibrate. I build because I’m not content to stand still.

---

## When I’m Not Working

You’ll find me:
- Fishing remote creeks from and backwaters from a fully-rigged kayak
- Backpacking through wild Texas and Colorado trails
- Competing in just about anything - discgolf, paintball, fishing, boxing, Texas 42
- Cooking over fire, reading science fiction, or training my Brittany pup

---

## Closing Thought

I believe in fierce clarity, deep thinking, good people, and meaningful work. My job is to clear the path so we can build something exceptional—together.

Let’s get after it.

## 📫 Let's Connect!

I'm always interested in connecting with fellow developers and collaborating on interesting projects!
